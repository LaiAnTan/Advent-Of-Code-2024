# Thought process

1. Try forward brute force (try every value of a++) and realise it does not work
2. if we reverse the program, we can determine the value of a
3. Try to understand what the program is doing by decompiling it
4. Notice the following observations:

    - The program is a while loop that ends when register a is 0.
    - Every iteration, register a is left shifted by 3 bits. (and this is the only instruction that modifies register a)
    - Registers b and c are dependent on the value of register a.

5. Reason about observations

    - since registers b and c are dependent on a, we only have to alter a
    - left shifting by 3 bits is equivalent to dividing by 8
        - every iteration, a is divided by 8 (octal number is influencing the output each iteration)
        - the number of iterations for the loop to end is ceil(log8(a))

    - Since the output has 16 numbers, we can determine the range of a that will produce an output of 16 numbers (every iteration, 1 number is output) by solving for a:
        >
        > ```python
        > 16 <= log8(a) <= 17
        > 16 <= log2(a) / 3 <= 17
        > 48 <= log2(a) <= 51
        > 2^48 <= a <= 2^51
        > ```
        >
        > Conclusion: `1,970,324,837,974,592` possible values of a that result in an appropriate output size, i.e. brute force is unviable even with restricted range.

6. Notice patterns in the inputs and outputs

    - try to find the octal number that will produce the last 1, 2, 3 , ... numbers of the program
        - the 1st digit will produce the last number in the program, 2nd digit => 2nd last and so on, i.e. some sort of brute force
        - the relationship between input digits and output number is many to one, i.e. more than 1 digit may correspond to 1 number in the output. Which means that wrongly selected previous digits that may have been right might cause no solution to be found, i.e. backtracking
